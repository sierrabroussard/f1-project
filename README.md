# Formula 1 Project

This is a small project I used for my Insight Data Science interview. It's a logistic regression model that predicts crashes in F1 races based off of driver and track stats.

Currently, it's a single Jupyter Notebook with some simple cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.

Eventually, I would like to improve this in a few ways:
  1. Change to a different classifier or prep data better (I used logistic regression and didn't scale anything)
  2. Add more features such as weather/other drivers in race
  3. Add a model that predicts all driver placements rather than just crashes
